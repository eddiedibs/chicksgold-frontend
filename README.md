# Front-end Design Chicks Gold üê£
This project focuses on recreating the "Items" section of Chicks Gold as part of a front-end technical challenge. The goal was to replicate the provided design using ReactJS and pure CSS, avoiding the use of any style frameworks. This approach highlights proficiency in building visually appealing and functional interfaces using core web development tools. The application includes the following features:

- Responsive Design: The interface seamlessly adjusts to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile),
  ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience across devices.

- Consistent Card Layout: The cards maintain uniform proportions and 
  dimensions across all screen sizes, providing a clean and organized look.
